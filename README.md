# vkontakte_wall_nn
My first neural network. The code is based a lot on what can be found on the Internet. The network was trained on the posts from the group in CIS social network VKontakte (group wall parser can also be found in the repository) with the goal to generate new posts. I was interested in how well such character-based RNN can be applied to Russian language.
